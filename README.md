# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ayush Chanekar

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a full-stack developer by day, a machine learning enthusiast by night,  
and a part-time YouTuber when I need a break from code.  
Whether I'm crafting seamless digital experiences or turning coffee into code, I'm always up for a challenge.

## 🚀 What I Do

### 🎥 [![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/@chanekarayush)
- Sharing what I know and learning as I go—subscribe if you’re into tech, tutorials, or the occasional dad joke.  
  

### 💻 Full-Stack Development
- **Front-End Magic:** Making the web look good one pixel at a time.
- **Back-End Sorcery:** Ensuring everything works behind the scenes (no black magic, I promise).

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Teaching machines to learn so they can (hopefully) do my homework one day.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🔬 Virtual Physics Lab
- **The Concept:** Bringing physics experiments to your screen, no lab coat required.
- **Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, and a dash of physics wizardry.

### 🗓️ Timetable Generator
- **The Problem:** Scheduling chaos, solved.
- **The Solution:** A generator that organizes your life (or at least your classes).

### 🗣️ Text-to-Speech Engine
- **What It Does:** Gives a voice to your text, quite literally.
- **Why It’s Cool:** Because who doesn’t love a good text-to-speech conversion?

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C++, and Sarcasm (fluent in all four).
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Django—basically, if it’s cool, I’ve probably tried it.
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL—because data needs a home.

## 💬 Let’s Connect!
